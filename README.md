Hello Guys

I hope you can enyoe this IDTool with the own IDList to make some things a bit easier

## IMPORTANT ##
## This isn't the original Minecraft 1.12 ID-List, the following list is created on my own ##
## If you want to convert Schematics from 1.12 to 1.13, you need to create a converter from the old IDs to this IDs ##
## Me thinking: "I could make a Converter... Should i make one? Just see it in the next days :P"  ##

## How to use: ##
1. Copy the Class into your Plugin
2. Intialize the Class in your Main Class
3. Make sure you set "api-version" to "1.13" in your plugin.yml
4. Use all the Stuff of the Class

## FAQ: ##

Where can i see which Block has which ID?
